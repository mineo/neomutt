/**
 * mutt_sasl_plain_msg - construct a base64 encoded SASL PLAIN message
 *
 * This function can be used to build a protocol-specific SASL Response message
 * using the PLAIN mechanism. The protocol specific command is given in the cmd
 * parameter. The function appends a space, encodes the string derived from
 * authz\0user\0pass using base64 encoding, and stores the result in buf.
 *
 * Example usages for IMAP and SMTP, respectively:
 * 
 * mutt_sasl_plain_msg(buf, sizeof(buf), "AUTHENTICATE PLAIN", user, user, pass);
 * mutt_sasl_plain_msg(buf, sizeof(buf), "AUTH PLAIN", NULL, user, pass);
 *
 * \param buf Destination buffer.
 * \param buflen Available space in the destination buffer.
 * \param cmd Protocol-specific string the prepend to the PLAIN message.
 * \param authz Authorization identity.
 * \param user Authentication identity (username).
 * \param pass Password.
 * \return The number of bytes written to buf.
